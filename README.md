# Hazard_Map

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Hazard_Map  
**Author:** Pirate-Emperor

## Description

Hazard_Map is a comprehensive repository developed by Pirate-Emperor that focuses on generating hazard maps from various lunar models, including Lunar_ISR, Crater_Detection, Height_Map, DTM_3D, Slope, Shadow, and Hazard_Map itself. This project combines the outputs of these models to create detailed hazard maps of the lunar terrain. Hazard maps play a crucial role in lunar exploration by identifying potential risks and hazardous areas for mission planning and research.

## Models Integration

Hazard_Map integrates the following models to derive hazard maps:

1. **Lunar_ISR:** Enhances the resolution of lunar images to provide clearer details.
2. **Crater_Detection:** Identifies and outlines impact craters on the lunar surface.
3. **Height_Map:** Generates high-resolution lunar height maps for accurate topographic information.
4. **DTM_3D:** Estimates the depth information of lunar terrain from 2D images.
5. **Slope:** Provides slope maps derived from the lunar terrain.
6. **Shadow:** Generates shadow maps based on lighting conditions and lunar features.
7. **Hazard_Map:** Combines the outputs of various models to create a comprehensive hazard map.

## Features

1. **Comprehensive Hazard Mapping:** Hazard_Map combines the outputs of various models to create detailed hazard maps, incorporating slope, shadow, and crater information for accurate risk assessment.

2. **Customizable Risk Parameters:** Researchers and users can adjust parameters to customize risk assessments based on specific lunar exploration scenarios.

3. **Integration Support:** Hazard_Map provides APIs and integration support for seamless incorporation into lunar exploration applications and mission planning.
